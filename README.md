<h4>Context:</h4>
In high energy physic experiments, gas mixture is the sensitive medium where the charge multiplication is producing the signal identifying the studied particle. The correct and stable gas mixture is a fundamental requirement for the good and longterm operation of a high energy physic experiment detector (e.g. ATLAS, ALICE, CMS or LHCb experiments on the CERN LHC accelerator). The basic function of the gas system is to mix different gas, e.g. N2, Ar, SF6, CF4, Xe, C4F10, C2H2F4, iC4H10, in the appropriate proportion and to distribute the mixture to the individual chambers of a detector.
